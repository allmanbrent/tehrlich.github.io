	 </thead>
	<tr>
		<td>Score and Perc.</td>
		<td>I, II, III, and IV</td>
		<td>The score never indicates cymbal choices. Although it's generally obvious, the first movement is considerably crisper in sound when a stick is used with a suspended cymbal versus traditional crash cymbals.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Score</td>
		<td>I, m.24</td>
		<td>Flute 2 is missing a tie between beats 2 and 3.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Score</td>
		<td>I, m.74</td>
		<td>Ambiguous marking; the solo is in clarinet 2.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Score and Tpt. 2</td>
		<td>I, m.139</td>
		<td><i>Not entirely errata, but an observation.</i>Trumpet 1 and 3 are "open", but trumpet 2 is not. The score reminds trumpet 2 at m.135 to be muted, but it seems odd that 2/3 of the trumpets would be open on a unison line.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Score and Perc.</td>
		<td>I, m.139</td>
		<td><i>Not entirely errata, but an observation.</i> There is no crash cymbal hit on beat 1, but the orchestral version and the recording by the North Texas Wind Symphony include it.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Score</td>
		<td>I, m.172</td>
		<td>The bells rhythm is difficult to read. It should be an eighth rest, two sixteenth notes on 'G', and an eighth note 'G' on beat 2.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Tuba</td>
		<td>II, m.24</td>
		<td>The tuba part has an extra eighth note; the score is correct.???</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Score and Parts????</td>
		<td>II, mm.32-34</td>
		<td>Inconsistant articulations between parts.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Score and Bsn.</td>
		<td>II, m.40</td>
		<td>Missing crescendo found in both baritone and bass parts.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Percussion</td>
		<td>II, m.85</td>
		<td>Instrument is ambigeous; it should be triangle and not snare drum.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Score and Bsn. ????</td>
		<td>II, m.172</td>
		<td>Missing articulation on beat 1 - should be stacatto and accent.</td>
	</tr>
