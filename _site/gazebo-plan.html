      <p>This rehearsal format is based off of Frank Battisti&#39;s model in <em>On Becoming a Conductor</em>. The rehearsal scope is my own addition, and is rated from the following scale: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Very Macro &mdash; Broad strokes on the entire piece, or several movements.</p>

<p>Macro &mdash; A single movement through one lens, themes, and form.</p>

<p>Micro &mdash; A focus on individual motives, balance, blend, shaping, etc.</p>

<p>Very Micro &mdash; Very specific matters, e.g., note length/attacks/releases, articulation, etc.</p>

        <td>In 40 minutes, we successfully ran though and discussed main ideas behind the work. Descriptors for movement 1 included joyous, upbeat, political (?). Movement 3 was well summarized by Josh, "bitter sweet." There were many blank stares from the ensemble when asked for their input. Calling on students was necessary, but it got everyone more engaged. It's hard to tell how many of them enjoy actively learning about the work, versus just the "fix-it" mentality so frequently used in rehearsals, but personally, I believe it'll help grow their overall musicianship.</td>

        <td>Read through Movement 2, focusing on the same initial matters (moods, feelings) as the first rehearsal. Start rehearsing movement 1, pointing the main themes and how they should be approached musically. If time remains, read through movement 4, and explain why it will be rehearsed considerably less than the other three.</td>
        <td>Movement 2 went quite well. We took it initially under tempo (~132 bpm) to ensure playability, but quickly raised it to closer to performance tempo. Descriptors included "creepy circus" and "lopsided". We briefly discussed what characteristics give this feel: frequent harmonic shifts and asymmetrical meter. In movement 1, we focused on main motives and the best way to approach them musically. We also started speaking about style. The read through of movement 4 was surprisingly poor in quality. Issues were mainly caused by a lack of counting and confidence in playing more exposed sections. This will be rehearsed on Thursday. <b>add Robert Notes</b></td>
