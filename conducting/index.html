			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>Growing up, I always had an interest in conducting. I served as the drum major of the Paramus High School Spartan Marching Band and conducted a work in concert and at Commencement and during my last semester.<p>
			<p>I found the <a href="http://www.melodramatics.com">Melodramatics Theatre Company</a> when browsing the list of Cornell clubs. I was hired my first semester, and since then, I've conducted seven musicals with the MTC. Many of the members are my closest friends.</p>
			<p>During my sophomore year, I took a conducting classes with Professor Cynthia Johnston Turner. After that semester, I served as the teaching assistant for the Wind Symphony, where I helped conduct the ensemble in rehearsal and concert. To continue improving skills, I completed Advanced Conducting with Dr. Peterson at Ithaca College during Spring 2012. I also conducted at symposiums with Allan McMurray, Michael Haithcock, Rodney Dorsey, and Thomas McCauley. Mallory Thompson also led a symposium I played clarinet in.</p>
			<p>In my free time, I enjoy reading conducting texts and studying scores.</p>

			<h3>The Melodramatics Theatre Company</h3>
			<p>I got involved with the MTC right when I got to Cornell in the Fall of 2010 and it was the student organization I have been involved with throughout my entire Cornell career. Over the past seven semesters, I have conducted <em>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street</em>, <em>Spring Awakening</em>, <em>RENT</em>, <em>The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee</em>, <em>bare: a pop opera</em>, <em>Little Women: The Musical</em>, and <em>Dirty Rotten Scoundrels</em>.</p>
			<p>Although I was hooked in through the conducting position, I've worked on several other aspects before.  During my junior and senior years, I served as the Business Manager; I oversaw the budgeting for each show, ticket sales, quarterly taxes, and other fiscal responsibilities to keep our 501(c)(3) status active. I also updated the content on the <a href="http://www.melodramatics.com">website</a> and worked on a redesign of it for my web programming class during the Spring of 2013. Although content is still being migrated to it, you can check out a preview <a href="http://www.melodramatics.com/new">here.</a></p>
			<p>I'm very excited to say that I was recently asked to join the Board of Trustees. This group consists of alumni of the organization that oversee the staffing process, assist in show selection, and provide guidance to the current General Manager of the company.</p>
