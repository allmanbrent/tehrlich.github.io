This rehearsal format is based off of Frank Battisti's model in *On Becoming a Conductor*. The rehearsal scope is my own addition, and is rated from the following scale: 

>Very Macro &mdash; Broad strokes on the entire piece, or several movements.

>Macro &mdash; A single movement through one lens, themes, and form.

>Micro &mdash; A focus on individual motives, balance, blend, shaping, etc.

>Very Micro &mdash; Very specific matters, e.g., note length/attacks/releases, articulation, etc.

		<td>1</td>
		<td>10/1/13</td>
		<td>Very Macro</td>
		<td>Sight reading, with as few stops as possible. Provide brief background to the work, its origins as a piano solo, and then play it!</td>
		<td>Good sight reading! Not too much to report here. We have a lot of work to do, but we mostly made it through the initial run.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>10/3/13</td>
		<td>Macro</td>
		<td>Read through movements 1 and 3. Discuss their overall moods, and figure out what feelings are evoked. "What do we need to musically to make these happen for the audience?"</td>
		<td>In 40 minutes, we successfully ran though and discussed main ideas behind the work. Descriptors for movement 1 included joyous, upbeat, political (?). Movement 3 was well summarized by Josh, "bitter sweet." There were many blank stares from the ensemble when asked for their input. Calling on students was necessary, but it got everyone more engaged. It's hard to tell how many of them enjoy actively learning about the work, versus just the "fix-it" mentality so frequently used in rehearsals, but personally, I believe it'll help grow their overall musicianship.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3</td>
		<td>10/8/13</td>
		<td>Macro (some Micro)</td>
		<td>Read through Movement 2, focusing on the same initial matters (moods, feelings) as the first rehearsal. Start rehearsing movement 1, pointing the main themes and how they should be approached musically. If time remains, read through movement 4, and explain why it will be rehearsed considerably less than the other three.</td>
		<td>Movement 2 went quite well. We took it initially under tempo (~132 bpm) to ensure playability, but quickly raised it to closer to performance tempo. Descriptors included "creepy circus" and "lopsided". We briefly discussed what characteristics give this feel: frequent harmonic shifts and asymmetrical meter. In movement 1, we focused on main motives and the best way to approach them musically. We also started speaking about style. The read through of movement 4 was surprisingly poor in quality. Issues were mainly caused by a lack of counting and confidence in playing more exposed sections. This will be rehearsed on Thursday. <b>Notes from <a href="http://www.gleeclub.com/meet-the-director.html">Robert Issacs:</a></b> Continue 'crowd sourcing' your rehearsals; it makes everyone quite engaged. Your Socratic rehearsal technique is effective. Consider mirroring less (although it's helpful in these beginning rehearsals) and being more conscientious about the perceived dynamic size from your pattern. Take a slower tempo on trickier spots, if you believe it will assist in note accuracy.</td>

		<td>Macro, some Micro</td>
		<td>Start with movement 2 at full tempo, but still beat the 3/4s in three and the 5/4s in five. Work on evoking the different moods of the movement, and draw attention to spots that still need personal practice. Fix all incorrect notes and missed entrances. Rehearse movement 4 slowly, section by section, under tempo. Demonstrate the significant dynamic contrast needed and the importance of listening across the ensemble for a consistent pulse. If time remains, run the movement at the end.</td>
		<td>This rehearsal was extremely successful. Movement 2 is falling well under the fingers, except several technically difficult passages (for example, flute/piccolo/xylophone mm. 46-50). Cindi suggested I rehearse movement 4 from end to beginning, which worked well. We ran the movement at the end of rehearsal to put all of our work into context. Since this was the rehearsal right before fall break, we ended five minutes early.</td>

		<td>Very Macro, then Micro</td>
		<td>Since we are now 1/3 through the rehearsal process, run the entire work, having students note sections that need attention. Write them down, and tackle the larger ones today, and others on Thursday.</td>
