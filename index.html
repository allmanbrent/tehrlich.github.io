		<div id="about">
			<p>Tyler Ehrlich is currently a junior at <a href="http://cornell.edu">Cornell University</a>, where he studies many things - especially music.  Tyler plays clarinet and bass clarinet in the <a href="http://cuwinds.com">Wind Ensemble</a> and <a href="http://www.arts.cornell.edu/orchestra/">Symphony Orchestra</a>, and studies in the studio of Lenora Schneller.  In January 2012, Tyler accompanied the Wind Ensemble to Costa Rica on their biennial performance and service tour, and he is very much looking forward to return in 2014.</p>
			
			<p>Tyler studies conducting with his advisor, <a href="http://music.cornell.edu/people/faculty/?page=cudm/facultyCtrl&amp;action=detail/id=42">Cynthia Johnston Turner</a>, and is the Pit Orchestra Director for the <a href="http://melodramatics.com">Melodramatics Theatre Company, Inc.</a>, Cornell's premier student run musical theatre organization.  This upcoming fall marks his seventh semester with the company, and he is excited to be among the staff to produce <em>Sweeney Todd</em> in November.  Tyler is the teaching assistant for the Cornell University <a href="http://cuwinds.com">Wind Symphony</a>, where he assists in rehearsing and conducting the ensemble in concert.</p>
			
			<p>In addition to music, Tyler has taken coursework in the <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu">computer science</a> and <a href="http://infosci.cornell.edu">information science</a> departments.  During his freshman and sophomore year, Tyler worked at <a href="http://cit.cornell.edu/">Cornell Information Technologies</a>, both in support and application development.  He has built several web apps for CUWinds and is currently developing an Android Bird Song Player for the <a href="http://birds.cornell.edu">Cornell University Lab of Ornithology</a>.</p>

			<p>In his free time, Tyler enjoys spending time with his parents <a href="http://imagezone.com">Doug</a> and <a href="http://royalcaninemobilegrooming.com">Ellen</a>, and sisters Blake and Hannah (and brother-in-law <a href="http://ods.org">Jason</a> too!)  He is an amateur photographer, and enjoys sailing and scuba diving.</p>
